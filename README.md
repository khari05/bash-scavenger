## Bash Scavenger
This is a small bash scavenger hunt I made to try to teach the linux command line.

## Configuration
### Setup

Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

### Run with Docker
```bash
$ docker run --rm -it khari05/bash-scavenger
```
`--rm` makes the container auto remove on exit

`-i` keeps the image open when no process is running

`-t` opens the shell

## Resources the scavenger hunt includes
