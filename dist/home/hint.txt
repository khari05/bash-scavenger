Got a question? Use Google.
Contrary to popular belief, Google will always be an available resource.
If you have a question, most likely someone will have had the same question and posted it and a solution online.

If all else fails, the leadership will probably be able to suggest the correct search terms to find what you're looking for.
(We don't know everything either. IT is mostly just people who are good at Googling)
